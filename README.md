# Python Robotics Algorithms 

This repository contains an initial version of a path planning algorithm based on a desired trapezoidal velocity profile considering two given collision-free waypoints in a confined space (R3) for an autonomous underwater vehicle (). The goal is to evolve this repository with new algorithms and applications for different types of problems and robots.  


# Requirements

- Python 3.7.x (2.7 is not supported)

- numpy

- matplotlib


# How to use

1. Clone this repo.

> git clone https://github.com/gabrielfpacheco/robotics.git

> cd robotics/


2. Install the required libraries. You can use environment.yml with conda command.

> conda env create -f environment.yml


3. Execute the main.py script inside the directory.

> python main.py


4. The unit tests will be performed and an example will be plotted.
